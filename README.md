# data-sourcing-challenge
M6 Challenge

This challenge was about using the API keys to retrieve new york times data and TMDB data and eventually merging them in a data frame and saving them as a CSV file. 

This challenge gave me a lot of issues, and I eventually had to get tutoring help especially on the functions and loops for retrieving the data.  

Extracted the data first from NYT then TMBD saved them each in .json then converted to pandas dataframes before merging both dataframes and saving into a merged df, formatting the new columns and outputting into the output.csv file.
